    <p class="indent">Because of his extreme wealth and suave good looks, Gene Tancowney could seemingly have any woman he wanted.  He was a man with a women on his arm at every social event.</p>
    <br/>
    <p class="indent">Gene living in Sherwood Park, headed to the north side of Edmonton in search of an escort (I mean...) a dental assistant to hire for an entire week, 24/7.  He was looking for a professional who would not be committed to him, yet, not have any commitments to her, after the week is over.  He gave her large amount of money, only for her to go shopping at WEM.  The sales ladies were able to transform Sylvia into a Cinderella.</p>
    <br/>
    <p class="indent">The question here becomes whether Sylvia will go back to her north side lifestyle or does she continue her life with prince charming beyond that one week.  Will Gene see her as that North side girl, or as that Cinderella she truly is.</p>
    <br/>
    <p class="indent">Sylvia Grof has found a way of living, by working as a dental assistant. When she ran into the prince of her dreams, who came along on his white horse...(I mean, drove by on his motorcycle).  She first does not recognize him as her savior.  The prince, a ruthless and wealthy pressman (lol), does not know that she could be more than just a girl from the north side, but he quickly changes his thoughts after the first night with the beautiful stranger.</p>
    <br/>
    <p class="indent">Sylvia, being the first person in a very long time to surprise him and Gene, slowly realizing that Sylvia might be the one. He is now becoming a happier person and they both have an opportunity for a new beginning.</p>
    <br/>
    <p class="indent">A man, in search of an escort to have on his arm for social events, hires a beautiful dental assistant... Only to fall in love!</p>

    Well...
    <br/>
    <p class="margin">It all felt like Pretty Woman at the time!</p>
    <br/>
    Actually...
    <br/>
    <p class="margin">We met at the Moksha Studio and chatted for 3 months before I had asked him out.</p>
    <br/>
    3 years later...
    <br/>
    <p class="margin">On New Years Eve, back at the Moksha Studio, surrounded by roses, rose petals, candles and Gene on one knee, he proposed and I happily accepted.</p>
    <br/>
    <p class="indentlots">With Love, Sylvia</p>
